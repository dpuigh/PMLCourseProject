# Practical Machine Learning Course Project (predmachlearn-015)

This repository contains the material for the course project of the Practical Machine Learning course in the data science specialization. It contains the following files:

* Practical_Machine_Learning_Course_Project.R = The R code used to produce all the results.
* Practical_Machine_Learning_Course_Project.Rmd = The R markdown file used to writeup the result. 
* Practical_Machine_Learning_Course_Project.html = The html file created from the Rmd file.
* README.md = This readme file.
* bibliography.bib = The bibliography used in the Rmd file.
* pml_write_files.R = A function used to create the final submitted result.

The Rmd file was converted to htmlvia the command
```
rmarkdown::render("Practical_Machine_Learning_Course_Project.Rmd", "html_document")
```
This was done so that the R code could be run once but the Rmd could be edited and compiled many times while using the global environment from the former.
